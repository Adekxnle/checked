A daily-task managing web application built with react.js

## Build

``` 
npm i
npm start 
```
>npm might act wierd, mine did. don't worry just use yarn
``` 
yarn i
yarn start 
```
## The Idea
yeah, i known its another todo list app trying to sound fancy. but think of having a clean slate everyday without 
being reminded of what you did or didn't do the previous day.

## Stack
>React, LocalStorage, React Context-API
